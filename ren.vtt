00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.800
the renaissance we're talking about the

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.800
period of european history mainly taking

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.800
place in italy from the 14th to the 16th

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.800
century bridging the gap between the

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.800
middle ages and modern day civilization

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.800
the word renaissance means rebirth in

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.800
this case the rebirth of the classical

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.800
greek and roman arts and philosophy

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.800
following the middle ages an era often

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.800
branded as a time of war cultural

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.800
decline and pandemics such as the black

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.800
death

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.800
humanism was really at the heart of the

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.800
renaissance a philosophy inspired by

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.800
classical greek and roman texts

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.800
celebrating human creativity individual

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.800
achievement in different fields and

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.800
promoting the idea that man was the

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.800
center of his own universe not god this

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.800
new mindset contrasted with medieval

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.800
philosophy which centered on the divine

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.800
and on following the rules set forth by

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.800
the catholic church as god's plan

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.800
the renaissance started in florence

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.800
italy which became very wealthy thanks

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.800
to trade with the ottoman empire the

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.800
biggest economic power in the region

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.800
fewer theories accounting for the

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.800
origins of the renaissance include the

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.800
reintroduction of classical texts to

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.800
italy through the immigration of

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:17.800
scholars following the fall of

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.800
constantinople and through returning

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.800
crusaders who had encountered advanced

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.800
muslim civilizations that had kept

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.800
copies and translations also members of

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.800
the powerful and wealthy medici family

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.800
of florence were famous backers of the

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.800
movement and supported public art for

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.800
recognition for the love of beauty and

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.800
also to legitimize their wealth the

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.800
movement later expanded to other italian

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.800
city-states such as venice milan rome

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.800
and then throughout western and northern

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.800
europe by scholars such as dutch

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.800
philosopher erasmus

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.800
thanks to the development of printing by

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.800
guttenberg and europe little known texts

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.800
from early humanist authors such as

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.800
petrarch were distributed to the masses

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.800
as literature rose as an important

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.800
aspect of everyday life

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.800
dante's divine comedy machiavelli's

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.800
prince and shakespeare's hamlet were

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.800
some of the most notable pieces of

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.800
literature of the renaissance

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.800
perhaps the most prominent feature of

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.800
the renaissance was the furthering of

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.800
the arts

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.800
the apex of artistic talent came later

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.800
during the high renaissance in the form

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.800
of leonardo da vinci raphael and

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.800
michelangelo who were supported by the

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.800
medeshi family

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.800
their paintings and sculptures featured

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.800
an atomically accurate human bodies in

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.800
complex poses dramatic and emotional

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.800
compositions naturalistic depictions of

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.800
space and intellectually sophisticated

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.800
subject matter notable examples include

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.800
the mona lisa the last supper the statue

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.800
of david the birth of venus and the

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.800
creation of adam the most prevalent

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.800
societal change during the renaissance

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.800
was the fall of feudalism and the rise

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.800
of a capitalist market economy increased

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.800
trade and the labor shortage caused by

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.800
the black death gave rise to something

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.800
of a middle class as workers started

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.800
demanding wages and better living

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.800
conditions

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.800
the development of the middle class and

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.800
the rise of humanism encouraged

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.800
europeans to question the role of the

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.800
catholic church and caused its influence

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.800
to wane in such context a german monk

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.800
named martin luther challenged many of

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.800
the practices of the church like

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.800
nepotism and the selling of indulgences

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.800
and led the protestant reformation a

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.800
revolutionary movement that caused the

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.800
split in the catholic church

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.800
to break ottoman dominance over access

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.800
to india and the far east europeans were

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.800
eager to explore new trade routes for

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.800
gold and spices in the age of

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.800
exploration columbus discovered the

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.800
americas in 1492 and magellan became the

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.800
first person to successfully

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.800
circumnavigate the globe in the early

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.800
1500s

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.800
placing the sun at the center of the

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.800
solar system rather than the earth was a

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.800
major breakthrough in the history of

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.800
science by polish astronomer copernicus

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.800
though his book was banned by the

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.800
catholic church

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.800
galileo galilei later also found

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.800
evidence for a heliocentric solar system

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.800
in addition to improving the telescope

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.800
and conducting experiments that paved

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.800
the way for newton's discoveries about

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.800
gravity

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.800
by the early 17th century the

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.800
renaissance movement had died out for

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.800
different reasons including the invasion

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.800
of italian territories by neighboring

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.800
powers and the catholic church

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.800
censorship of artists and writers in

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.800
response to the protestant reformation

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.800
as well as the establishment of the

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.800
inquisition which made any views that

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.800
challenged the church an act of heresy

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.800
punishable by death

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.800
many historians prefer to think of the

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.800
renaissance as an arts and cultural

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.800
movement rather than a historical period

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.800
that is distinct from the middle ages

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.800
since there are no clear dividing lines

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.800
between the two periods also most

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.800
historians claim the renaissance was

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.800
only experienced by the very rich

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.800
whereas for the vast majority of

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.800
europeans who were peasants it was not

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.800
really a thing the reason we studied the

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.800
renaissance so much is not because it

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.800
was so central to the 15th century but

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.800
because it matters to us now because of

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.800
the legacy of humanism and individualism

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.800
that strongly influenced the

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.800
euro-american world ever since

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
